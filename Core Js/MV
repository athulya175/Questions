big int is a built-int numeric type in js for integers larger than number 

Two ways to create big int
    1) literal with n sufix
    2)Using the constructor

% When we use map need to use split before it
% parseInt()reads the string from left to right and stops at the first non-digit character
% if the string doesn't start with a number it returns NaN

console.log(parseInt("123abs"))    //123
console.log(parseInt("abc123"))    //NaN


Hoisting  
    When js runs a code it  passes to two phases creation & execution
        in creation phase variables that declared in var moves to the top of the scope,but they are declared only not initialized so that when we use console before initialization it says undefined insted of a refference error(like let and const)
        Execution phase the code runs line by line

% variable var has only scope outside the block


% in looping there is for of and for in 

for of is used to get values 
for in is used to get valaues and index

ARROW FUNCTION---> const function_name =(params)=>{}

% To add an element at the begining of an array use unshift--->unshift("element")
% To remove an element at the begining of an array use shift---->Shift()
% To remove at a perticular index we can use splice operator---->splice(starting index,delete count)

let arry1=[4,2,9,1]
let sorts=arry1.sort((a,b)=>a-b)           -->if a-b is negative then a comes before b else b
console.log(sorts)

% to get length of a object need to use object.key
